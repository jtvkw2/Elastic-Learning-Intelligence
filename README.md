## Usage

## ToDos
- [ ] Add Flask Login

- [ ] Fix Data Ingestion
- [ ] Create data ingestion API
- [ ] Add dropdown for initial search filtering on search page
- [ ] Finish settings page for creation of mapping files from Node class creation
  - [ ] Modularize in a way that more data formats and graph dbs can be added later
  - [ ] Need to seperate out data sources
- [ ] Create custom Name Entity Recognition model with custom glossary
